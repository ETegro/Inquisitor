# NAME=Memory benchmark: STREAM
# DESCRIPTION=The STREAM benchmark is a simple synthetic benchmark program that measures sustainable memory bandwidth (in MiB/s) and the corresponding computation rate for simple vector kernels. A version written in C language and optimized for single processor systems is used.

# As STREAM benchmark is rather fast, we will easily run it several
# times. Results won't diverge meaningfully.
