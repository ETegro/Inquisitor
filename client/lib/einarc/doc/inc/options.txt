`-V`, `\--version`::
  Print program version and exit.
`\--help`::
  Show short help text and exit.
`-l`, `\--list`::
  List all adapters found in system and exit.
`-h`, `\--human`::
  Output human-readable information. By default, Einarc outputs data in
  tab-separated format that's easier to parse in scripts. Using this
  option makes output a bit more comfortable to read by humans: tables
  would have headers and they will be formatted with spaces to ensure
  fixed width fields.
`-t`, `\--type=TYPE`::
  type (manufacturer) of RAID adapter; use `-l` (`\--list`) option to
  list all types of 
`-a`, `\--adapter=NUM`::
  select the adapter if multiple adapters of a given type are present.

You can omit `-t` if there's only one adapter type in the system.
Omitting `-a` would select first available adapter of that type.
