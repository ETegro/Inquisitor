*Warning!* Don't run this unless you know what you're doing. This wizard
asks no questions and, unless you run it during the system installation
phase, most likely would delete all the data on all of your hard drives.

*einarc* should be properly installed in the system (i.e. all required
proprietary CLIs are downloaded, unpacked and installed) before using
this script. See *einarc-install*(8) on this topic.
