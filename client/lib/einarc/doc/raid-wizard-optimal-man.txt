= raid-wizard-optimal(8)

== Name

raid-wizard-optimal - create optimal array configuration for all RAID
adapters

== Synopsis

*raid-wizard-optimal*

== Description

*raid-wizard-optimal* tries to create an optimal array configuration for
all RAID adapters available in the system using *einarc*(1). It tries to
guess system builder's intent for hard disc allocation, although,
"optimal" is highly subjective and your mileage may vary.

This wizard does the the following for every supported RAID controller:

1. Removes all logical discs present at the controller.
2. Groups all available physical discs by model (model usually includes
size).
3. For every group, if there are:
* 1 disc in the group - creates RAID 0 logical disc;
* 2 discs in the group - creates RAID 1 logical disc;
* >=3 discs in the group:
** If RAID controller supports RAID 5, creates RAID 5 logical disc that
includes all discs in the group.
** Otherwise, breaks group into pairs of same discs, creating RAID 1 on
each pair, and, possibly, one standalone disc that would be initialized
as passthrough.
4. Waits for controller to finish initialization.

== Examples

Adapter that supports RAID 5, physical discs include 2 fast SAS 146GB
discs (0:0, 0:1) and 5 slower SATA 1TB discs (1:0, 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 1:4).
*raid-wizard-optimal* would create a following configuration:

* Logical disc 0: RAID 1 (0:0, 0:1) - 146GB
* Logical disc 1: RAID 5 (1:0, 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 1:4) - 4TB

Same disc configuration, but adapter does not support RAID 5:

* Logical disc 0: RAID 1 (0:0, 0:1) - 146GB
* Logical disc 1: RAID 1 (1:0, 1:1) - 1TB
* Logical disc 2: RAID 1 (1:2, 1:3) - 1TB
* Logical disc 3: Passthrough (1:4) - 1TB

Adapter that supports RAID 5, 3 SATA discs of various sizes and models -
250GB, 500GB, 750GB (0:0, 0:1, 0:2):

* Logical disc 0: RAID 0 (0:0) - 250GB
* Logical disc 1: RAID 0 (0:1) - 500GB
* Logical disc 2: RAID 0 (0:2) - 750GB
