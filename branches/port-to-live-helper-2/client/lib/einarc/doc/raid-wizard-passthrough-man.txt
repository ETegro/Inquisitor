= raid-wizard-passthrough(8)

== Name

raid-wizard-passthrough - makes some physical discs to appear in the
system as distinct devices

== Synopsis

*raid-wizard-passthrough* [_GROUP-SIZE_] [_GROUP-NUMBER_]

== Description

*raid-wizard-passthrough* makes some of the physical discs (connected to
RAID controllers) visible in the system as distinct devices (i.e.
logical discs). It does so by doing the following for every supported
RAID controller:

1. Remove all logical discs present at the controller.
2. Add all physical discs as logical discs, trying to use "passthrough"
mode, if possible.

== Options

By default, *raid-wizard-passthrough* would work with all physical
discs, connected to the controller, thus making a *logical disc* from
every single *physical disc*. However, some systems and/or RAID
controllers might have limits on a number of logical discs that can be
created simultaneously.

To work around this issue, we can work on a subset of physical discs.
For ease of enumeration, we work with groups of the same size, and
iterate over group numbers.

_GROUP-SIZE_::
  number of physical discs in a group

_GROUP-NUMBER_::
  sequential number of a group (starting from 0)

== Example

Given a system with 24 physical discs (0:0 to 0:23), one might use
sequential calls to *raid-wizard-passthrough* to iterate over all 24
discs, 8 discs at a time:

 raid-wizard-passthrough 8 0

(yields 0:0 to 0:7 as /dev/sda .. /dev/sdh)

 raid-wizard-passthrough 8 1

(yields 0:8 to 0:15 as /dev/sda .. /dev/sdh)

 raid-wizard-passthrough 8 2

(yields 0:16 to 0:23 as /dev/sda .. /dev/sdh)
