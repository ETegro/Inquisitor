`\--modules=LIST`::
  a comma-separated list of storage support modules to build:
* all -- SPECIAL: build all available modules, default
* auto -- SPECIAL: autodetect which modules are required -- experimental
feature, added since v1.4, tries to make an automatic guess by analysing
PCI IDs of machine where you run `./configure`; requires `lspci` to run.
If in doubt, just use "all" -- it will download everything, all CLIs not
usable on current machine just won't be used.
* lsi_megarc -- older LSI MegaRAID SCSI/SATA adapters
* adaptec_arcconf -- newer Adaptec adapters that use arcconf
* amcc -- 3Ware/AMCC RAID 7/8/9xxx/95xxx series controllers that use tw_cli
* lsi_megacli -- newest LSI MegaRAID SAS adapters
* adaptec_aaccli -- older Adaptec SCSI adapters that use aaccli
* areca -- Areca adapters
