# NAME=HDD benchmark: Hdparm
# DESCRIPTION=This benchmark runs on all hard drives in the system sequentially. Every hard drive is benchmarked for the buffered speed and the cached speed using basic hdparm -t and -T tests for several times. The results for every HDD are averaged and presented as benchmark results.
