== v1.2

* Support for new RAID devices: newer Adaptec adapters using arcconf.
* New objects "bbu" and "firmware" are introduced: now it's possible to
get information about BBU and read/write firmware to supported adapters.
* More strict "adapter info" report: it outputs serial number and tries
to pinpoint a particular adapter using PCI IDs, if possible.
* Updates for existing devices:
** aaccli: now it downloads and uses later, more acceptable version, not
linked against arts library. Note, however, that
Adaptec_Storage_Manager-Linux_v2.10.00 is a huge ~36M download.
** megacli: updated version to 1.01.27.
* Multiple stability, metadata and rare occurance fixes for all modules.
* Improved build system.
* "raid-wizard-passthrough" can be used to handle smaller groups of HDDs
(not all available devices).

== v1.1

* Added documentation in package
* Brand-new configure: now everything can be controlled from
command-line parameters, individual modules can be enabled/disabled at
compile time.
* Updated download/build mechanism: it asks for license agreement
interactively. For non-interactive builds, just touch proprietary/agreed
file.
* Bugfixes in lsi_megarc, adaptec_aaccli modules
* Compatibility with older Ruby (<1.8.6)

== v1.0

* First public release
