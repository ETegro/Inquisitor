== Name

einarc - manage and monitor hardware/software RAID controllers

== Synopsis

einarc [options] <object> <command> [<operands>]

== Description

*Einarc* manages and monitors hardware/software RAID controllers.
It unifies various RAIDs and storage devices, providing a simple
object-oriented interface for end-user. Inside, it works as a proxy,
translating commands from that object interface to RAID-specific
commands for it's proprietary CLI, and back, translating response from
proprietary CLI into unified answer.

*Einarc* is most useful as a scriptable power tool, so it outputs
everything in tab-separated machine-readable format by default.

Note that you still have to download and install proprietary CLIs (if
you want to use any hardware RAID). See *einarc-install*(8) for an
utility that automates this task.
