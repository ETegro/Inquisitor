= einarc-install(8)

== Name

einarc-install - download, unpack and install proprietary RAID
command-line utilities for einarc

== Synopsis

*einarc-install* --modules=_LIST_

== Description

*einarc-install* downloads, unpacks and prepares to use proprietary RAID
utilities that may be required by *einarc* to manage RAIDs.

Unless you use software RAID, hardware RAIDs usually require some sort
of proprietary utility to control it. *einarc* acts as a wrapper for
this proprietary utility, but before using it, this utility should be
downloaded and properly installed first. *einarc-install* takes care of
this task.

== Options

The only argument that *einarc-install* requires is a list of modules to
install.
