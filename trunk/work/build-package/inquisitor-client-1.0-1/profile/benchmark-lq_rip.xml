  This is reference mencoder_memory benchmark's profile.

  It simulates behavior of user quickly making rip for his
  low-resolution portable device.

  As a source movie we are using Big Buck Bunny FullHD H.264 version,
  downscale it to qVGA resolution with appropriate bitrate in single
  pass encoding mode with Low Quality preset. Sound will be ignored,
  as it is task for another benchmark.
