 h2. Einarc v1.4rc released

 Release candidate of a new version of Einarc, a subproject of
 Inquisitor that provides unified interface to all proprietary RAID
 (storage) controllers, announced today.

 Focus points that would be fully represented in final release:

 * Support for post-build reconfiguration of proprietary CLIs and
 supporting modules. This allows Einarc to be supplied via usual binary
 packaging methods (rpm/deb): proprietary CLIs can be installed after
 binary package installation using special setup tool "einarc-install".

 * Experimental support for hardware RAID autodetection in both
 build-time (configure) and run-time (einarc-install).

 * Many stability fixes and bug fixes.

 h2. First alpha version of Inquisitor v3.1 released

 We're pleased to announce first public alpha release on brand new
 Inquisitor v3.1 Live CD. This is experimental build made with Debian
 package base.

 Overview of new features in this Live CD build over 3.0 platform
 release:

 * Lots of improvements in Live CD: profiles at Live CD are also
 XML-based now, so they can be easily replaced/interchanged. Profiles
 can include each other. Live CD interface received major facelift to
 allow more control over testing process (including, for example,
 infinite testing).
 * Throughout support for new client platform: Debian (including builds
 of Enterprise and Live CD versions).
 * New class of modules - "software detects" are introduced. These
 modules detect and record versions and build options of software used
 for future reference.
 * Lots of new tests: array-configurator, bonnie++ version 0.2,
 boot_from_image, db_comparison_fast, dd, hdd-passthrough version 0.3,
 iozone, mencoder_hdd, mencoder_memory, partimage, stress-compress,
 torrent-upload.
 * New hardware detects: Infiniband, BBU.
 * New monitorings: loadavg.

 Lots of stability fixes and bug fixes were applied:

 * This release uses new version of Einarc (one-that-would-be-1.4) to
 manage hardware and software RAIDs on storage devices.
 * Heavily improved new hdd-badblocks utility.
 * Fixed many issues with XML indentation and compliance on client and
 server sides.
 * Many user interface and general outlook improvements.

 API extensions:

 * A hook that allows unconditional execution of code after test
 competion (like "finally").
 * Enhanced helper API for tests and detects in client's API.
 * Firmware test heavily uses hardware detects.
 * Benchmarks can publish measurement units.
 * Ability to change default filesystem used in many tests.

 Einarc, a subproject of Inquisitor that provides unified interface to
 all proprietary RAID (storage) controllers, gets a long-awaited
 facelift.

 * Support for 3ware / AMCC controllers by Andras Horvath.

 * Full read/write support of Linux software RAIDs.

 * Updated all proprietary utilities URLs, pumped up version numbers,
 fixed wrapper regular expressions to support new versions of CLIs.

 * Added new calculated fields in adapter_info: PCI product/subproduct
 and vendor/subvendor IDs. These allow precise identification of PCI
 devices related to adapters shown by Einarc.

 * Fuller BBU support for Adaptec adapters.

 * Multiple stability and build fixes (Makefile now supports parallel
 execution with "make -j").

 h2. Inquisitor v3.0 release

 Inquisitor team is pleased to announce Inquisitor v3.0 - a first major
 open-source version of the platform. After initial announcement of
 Inquisitor branch 3.x in August 2007, it's a fruit of almost a year of
 labor.

 Inquisitor version 3 is a major redesign of older 1.x and 2.x systems.
 New features:

 * Modularity: it consists of dozens of interconnected and
 interchangeable modules with well-defined API; one can easily add new
 modules to add new tests, detections, production steps, etc.

 * Three varieties: standalone (runs on top of already installed OS),
 live CD (can be used to analyse/test just one home computer), enterprise
 (server-controller network boot).

 * Flexibility: every test parameter can be adjusted, all system can be
 customized.

 * Server-controlled testing: server-based version includes a database
 that stores all the data on all computers that were tested by
 Inquisitor. If only some parts of hardware will change, clever scheduler
 won’t redo all the long testing, but only tests relevant to hardware
 changes.

 * Distributed workload: due to modular architecture, Inquisitor can be
 easily distributed across a cluster to distribute load or make a
 geographically distributed system.

 For those who would like to try Inquisitor, the easiest way is to download
 a 130MB ISO, available for both x86 and x86_64 from http://www.inquisitor.ru/.

 Comments and especially bug reports are welcome.

 Adaptec_Storage_Manager-Linux_v2.10.00 is a huge ~36M download.
