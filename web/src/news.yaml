 h2. Einarc v1.2 released

 After a half of year development cycle, new version of Einarc gets
 released today.

 <a href="{relocatable:/doc/einarc/}">Einarc</a> is a subproject of
 Inquisitor that provides unified interface to all proprietary RAID
 (storage) controllers. 

 h3. What's new

 * Support for new RAID devices: newer Adaptec adapters using *arcconf*.

 * New objects "bbu" and "firmware" are introduced: now it's possible to
 get information about BBU and read/write firmware to supported adapters.

 * More strict "adapter info" report: it outputs serial number and tries
 to pinpoint a particular adapter using PCI IDs, if possible.

 * Updates for existing devices:
 ** *aaccli*: now it downloads and uses later, more acceptable version,
 not linked against arts library. Note, however, that
 Adaptec_Storage_Manager-Linux_v2.10.00 is a huge ~36M download.
 ** *areca*: update to v1.80A_71012.
 ** *megacli*: updated to v1.01.27.
 
 * Multiple stability, metadata and rare occurance fixes for all modules.

 * Improved build system.

 * "raid-wizard-passthrough" can be used to handle smaller groups of
 HDDs (not all available devices).
