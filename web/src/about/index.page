Inquisitor is an open-source hardware testing and certification system,
suitable for both enterprise and home use, customizable, modular and
available in both serverless Live CD/DVD format and server-controlled
network boot production system.

It can <a href="{relocatable: /doc/detect.page}">analyse</a> and <a href="{relocatable: /doc/tests/index.page}">test</a>
your hardware from top to the bottom and assure that it won't fail easily under the production
stress.

Inquisitor is:

* *Flexible*: you can adjust just about any parameter in analysis or
testing process and customize the system to the widest extent.
* *Modular*: it's made up from a series of interchangeable modules; one
can easily add new modules to add new tests, detections, production
steps, etc.
* *Intelligent*: server-based version includes a database that stores
all the data on all computers that were tested by Inquisitor. If only
some parts of hardware will change, clever scheduler won't redo all the
long testing, but only tests relevant to hardware changes.
* *Distributed*: due to modular architecture, Inquisitor can be easily
distributed across a *cluster to distribute load* or make a
*geographically distributed* system.
* *Scalable*: it could be helpful to analyse/test just one home computer
or all the computers in your organization, up to multiple thousands
computers in manufacturing enterprise.
* *Free* as in speech: the base platform is distributed under the GPL license.
* *Mature*: Inquisitor is based on a rock-solid Linux technology and is
under active development since 2004. There are <a href="{relocatable:/about/screenshots.page}">multiple</a> production enterprise installations
relying on it.
