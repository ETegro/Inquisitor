h2. 2007-11-21: Einarc v1.1 released

<a href="{relocatable:doc/einarc/}">Einarc</a> is a subproject of
Inquisitor that provides unified interface to all proprietary RAID
(storage) controllers. 
 
Version 1.1 has following changes: 
 
* Added documentation in the package 
* Brand-new configure: now everything can be controlled from 
command-line parameters, individual modules can be enabled/disabled at 
compile time. 
* Updated download/build mechanism: it asks for license agreement 
interactively. For non-interactive builds, just touch proprietary/agreed 
file. 
* Bugfixes in lsi_megarc, adaptec_aaccli modules 
* Compatibility with older Ruby (<1.8.6)
