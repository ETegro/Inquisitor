h2. ODD write (odd_write)


This test is needed to record discs and at the same time to check corectness of this operation. It can detect if rewritable/recordable media is already inserted and tries to continue non-interactively. After detecting maximal writing speed (it can be forced by an option), blanking if it is rewritable non-blank media, it records specified ISO image. Then, it reads it to compare it's checksum with original one. After all of this we can make a conclusion about drives quality.

* *Components tested:* ODD
* *Variables:*
** *FORCE_NON_INTERACTIVE* (boolean, default: @false@) &mdash; Force non-interactive mode for already prepared system
** *TEST_IMAGE* (string, default: @iso/testimage.iso@) &mdash; ISO image path (absolute or relative)
** *TEST_IMAGE_BLOCKS* (int, default: @332800@) &mdash; This images size in blocks (2048 bytes each)
** *TEST_IMAGE_MD5* (string, default: @ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff@) &mdash; Test image MD5 hash
** *WRITE_MESSAGE* (string, default: @Writing test disc@) &mdash; Message to print when test will start
** *WRITE_SPEED* (int, default: @10@) &mdash; Default write speed if it won't detect
** *WRITE_SPEED_FORCE* (boolean, default: @true@) &mdash; Force write speed using
