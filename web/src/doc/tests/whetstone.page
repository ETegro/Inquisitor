h2. CPU benchmark: Whetstone (whetstone)


A synthetic computing benchmark that measures CPU floating-point performance. Inquisitor uses a C version and runs the specified number of loops, testing each CPU separately, with testing process running affined to particular CPU. Performance rating is in terms of MIPS.

* *Components tested:* CPU
* *Variables:*
** *LOOPS* (int, default: @200000@) &mdash; Loop count
