This test is a general-purpose benchmark designed to provide a basic evaluation of the performance of a Unix-like system. It runs a set of tests to evaluate various aspects of system performance, and then generates a set of scores. Here, we are using UnixBench version 5 (multi-CPU aware branch) without 2D/3D graphics benchmarks.
