h2. HDD benchmark: Bonnie (bonnie)

<div class="infobox"><img src="{relocatable:/images/hdd-destructive.png}" width="64" height="64" title="Test destroys contents of HDD" alt="Test destroys contents of HDD" /></div>

This test uses bonnie++ benchmark to test hard drives performance. For every hard drive in a system, test formats it using ext2 filesystem and then runs bonnie++ benchmark. Test measures the IO throughput in situations that simulate some types of database applications. It uses a single test file size to twice the amount of RAM. Benchmark reports output/rewrite/input of char/block speed and CPU load.

* *Components tested:* HDD
