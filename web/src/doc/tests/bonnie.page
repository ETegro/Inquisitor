h2. HDD benchmark: Bonnie (bonnie)

This test uses bonnie++ benchmark to test hard drives performance on different filesystems. For every hard drive in a system, test sequently creates specified filesystems on it and then runs bonnie++ benchmark itself. There are two sections to the programâ€™s operations. The first is to test the IO throughput in a fashion that is designed to simulate some types of database applications. The  second is to test creation, reading, and deleting many small files in a fashion similar to the usage patterns of programs such as Squid or INN. Bonnie++ tests some of them and for each test gives a result of the amount of work done per second and the percentage of CPU time this took.

* *Components tested:* HDD
* *Variables:*
** *DIRECTORIES_NUMBER* (int, default: @256@) &mdash; Number of directories to randomly distribute test files among them
** *FILESYSTEMS* (string, default: @ext2 ext3 vfat reiserfs xfs@) &mdash; Space-separated list of filesystems to be benchmarked
** *MAXIMAL_FILE_SIZE* (int, default: @1024@) &mdash; Maximal files size, KiB
** *MINIMAL_FILE_SIZE* (int, default: @10@) &mdash; Minimal files size, KiB
** *NUMBER_OF_FILES* (int, default: @2@) &mdash; The number of files for the file creation test. This is measured in multiples of 1024 files
