h2. Einarc

Einarc is a part of Inquisitor platform, a universal storage RAID
command line interface and an API that provides management for various
hardware/software RAID devices, uniting them all in a single paradigm.

h3. How does it work?

So far, anyone who wanted to manage a storage device had to download
proprietary management utility, learn it and use it. There's no even
single standard in the industry: for example, Areca uses 3-tier
hierarchy while building RAIDs (physical discs - raidsets - volumesets),
LSI uses 2-tier hierarchy (physical discs - logical discs).

Enter Einarc, a solution to unify proprietary storage management
paradigms. Einarc works as a translator that makes it possible for a
user to control all these devices using simple terms like "physical
disc", "logical disc", "adapter", etc, while transparently converting
these requests to proprietary RAID paradigms. In fact, the system still
uses underlying proprietary CLIs, but the user doesn't interact with
them directly, staying in a single, well-documented interface.

h3. Who would be interested to use Einarc?

* First of all, system administrators who have a large variety of
RAIDs/storage devices to manage and who want to manage them all in the
single paradigm. There's no need to remember lots of cryptic commands to
create volumes on particular model of RAID controller, it would be just
one single and simple command like <code>einarc logical add 5 100000
0:1,0:2,0:3</code> (that means add *logical* disc, *RAID level 5*, with
size of *100000 MB* and consisting of 3 physical drives: *0:1,0:2,0:3*).

* Second, Einarc is also a easy-to-use library that can be used in other
software that needs unified disc management. For example, it is used in
Inquisitor to test discs arrays, building and destroying various logical
disc combinations under the stress.
