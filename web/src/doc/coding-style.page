h2. Coding style guidelines

Inquisitor is a fairly complex system written in multiple languages, so
all developers *MUST* use the same set of coding style standards to avoid
unnecessary arguments and fights.

h3. Shell script

h4. Standards compliance

We aim to be portable among POSIX shells and thus we *SHOULD* use only
features specified in <a href="http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/xcu_chap02.html">POSIX shell standard</a>.
The common way to check for standards compliance is:

* Usage of @/bin/dash@ - Debian Almquist Shell
* Usage of following lints to check for bashisms and other unportable
constructions:
** WRITEMORE

h4. General formatting style

We prefer K&R-inspired general formatting style, with standard C-like
exception for functions, as they can't be nested in each other. This
example gives an overview of general pattern:

<pre>
some_function()
{
	local i
	local count=0
	while [ $# -gt 0 ]; do
		case "$1" in
		opt1) OPT1=1 ;;
		opt2) OPT2=1; count=$(($count + 1)) ;;
		longopt)
			do_something
			and_something_more --with "$OPT2"
			if [ "$OPT2" = 1 ]; then
				do_something
				and_something_more
			else
				OPT2=1
			fi
			;;
		list)
			for i in $LIST; do
				echo $i
			done
			;;
		esac
		shift
	done
}
</pre>

h4. Indentation

Indentation *MUST* be always 1 tab (@"\t"@). One can use whatever (s)he
likes to show tabs in his/her favorite text editor: 8 spaces per tab, 4
spaces, special symbols, proportional font, etc.

Indentation is a *MUST* for bodies of the following constructions on
distinct lines:

* functions
* @if@
* @while@
* @for@

Choices of @case@ *MUST NOT* be indented, as shown in example above.

h4. Line length

One *SHOULD* use lines of 72 characters long, but use common sense if in
doubt. It's common to use longer lines if it helps, but hurts
readability.

Continuation of long lines *MUST* be indented with one extra level of
indentation. starting with second line. One *SHOULD* use this technique,
for example, to group all options of a long command line, one option per
line of code:

<pre>
./configure \
	--with-libs=$LIBS \
	--with-feature=$FEATURE \
	--enable-debug \
	--disable-optimizations
</pre>

In case when it's possible to omit @\@, one *SHOULD* do omit it:

<pre>
[ -n "$VAR1" ] ||
	do_something --with=argument ||
	last_possible_fallback
cat some-file |
	grep something |
	sed 's/word1/word2/' |
	sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
</pre>

h4. Comments

All comments *SHOULD* be on the same level of indentation as the code it
refers to. All comments must start with @# @ (i.e. hash symbol and a space):

<pre>
# Comment
</pre>

One *SHOULD NOT* use inline comments. All comments that refer to a
specific line should go above that line.

For comments that mark up logical sections of a program, one *SHOULD*
use the following layout:

<pre>

# ======================================================================
# Header text for the following section
# ======================================================================

</pre>

That is: line full of @=@ up to maximum characters allowed, header text
describing following section, line full of @=@. Whole header *SHOULD* be
delimited with blank line before and after it.

h4. Functions

Functions *MUST* be declared without optional @function@ keyword:

<pre>
monitoring_start()
{
	...
}
</pre>

Globally useful functions should be declared in
@client/lib/main/functions@ or similar file. All these functions should
have a descriptive comment in <a href="{relocatable: shelldoc.page}">ShellDoc</a>
format.

Function names *SHOULD* be descriptive and *SHOULD* be generated as
@class_method@, if possible: @monitoring_start@, @test_promise_time@,
@memory_amount@, etc.

Functions *SHOULD NOT* be more than a screen (~24-30 lines) long and
*SHOULD NOT* use more than 5-6 levels of indentation. If algorithm is
very complex, try splitting it into more functions.

h4. Variables

Local functions variables *MUST* be declared as such in a function and
*MUST* be in @lower_case@. If a variable needs to be initialized,
initializion *SHOULD* be combined with declaration:

<pre>
local count=0
local i
</pre>

Global variables *MUST* be in @UPPER_CASE@. No extra declarations
required. One *SHOULD* use global variables, unless dealing with library
functions that *SHOULD* avoid messing up global variables and thus
*SHOULD* use local variables.

When accessing the variables, one *SHOULD NOT* use extra braces around
variable name (@${VAR}@) if it's possible to do so: @$VAR@. One *SHOULD*
use double quotes @"@ to access the variables that could contains spaces
(especially file/path names):

<pre>
cp "$SRC" "$DEST"
</pre>

h4. Conditions

WRITEMORE

h4. Arithmetic expansion

One *MUST* use @$(( ... ))@ for arithmetic expansion, and one *MUST*
reference variables inside this block as @$VAR@:

<pre>
x=$(($x + 2))
</pre>

One *MUST* delimit all arithmetic operators with spaces before and after an
operator.

One *SHOULD* be aware of limitation of shell arithmetic, in particular
that it can operate only on integers and on some platforms these
integers are only 32-bit signed int: so, for example, it's a bad idea to
use shell arithmetics to make calculations with values like number of
bytes on a modern HDD, etc.

h4. Command substitution

WRITEMORE

h4. Pipelining

WRITEMORE

h4. Complex algorithms

Shell scripting is fairly limited, so it's generally agreed upon that
it's best to use shell what it's designed for: to call other programs
and track the results. If solving a particular task with shell script
seem to be too awkward, one *SHOULD* use other scripting languages.

h4. Inquisitor-specific style notes
