h2. Choosing the right flavour

Inquisitor is a modular system that comes in several flavours.

In ideal world, testing a computer system is simple process: you load a
testing program, run it and get results. However, in our sub-optimal
world, things are somewhat more complex. The problem is that "testing
program" (i.e. Inquisitor and its tests) has to be stored somewhere
(i.e. on a hard disc or other storage media), but this storage media has
to be tested too. Serious storage media tests usually result in all data
overwritten, including testing program. So, Inquisitor has several
flavours to work-around this issue.
