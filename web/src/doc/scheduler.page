h2. Scheduler

Scheduler in Inquisitor is a program that concludes the decisions on
what tests to do, in what sequence, what parameters should be used for
each one, thus controlling the overall testing flow.

Scheduler involes a complex algorithm and should be tested throughly and
changed with care.

Constant data:

* Test shootout tables (depending on hardware delta).
* Metadata on all tests included in current chroot.

It operates using following input:

* Computer ID;
* How many tests to generate (one or many);

While preparing for schedule calculation, it obtains following data:

* A list of detected components for the last testing and pre-last
testing, if it exists.
* Testing profile data (which it can get by profile ID, which, in turn,
can be determined from computer).

It generates following output:

* Shall we start a new testing or not;
* One or multiple tests that should be run next, supplied with:
  * ID of testing stage,
  * Name of script to call,
  * Parameters to pass to script.

Output can be formatted in various manners:

* As a script to execute on client system under test,
* As a viewable list of further tests that will show up on
computer-related pages of web-site.
* As a throughly explained list of decisions that the scheduler had
made, for debugging.
