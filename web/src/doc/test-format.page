h2. Test format

Inquisitor's test files are essentially Unix shell scripts that act as
launchers to run and control real (usually binary) test programs. Test
scripts also include some meta-information in specially formatted header
comments.

h3. General requirements

There are some requirements that test scripts must meet:

* First non-comment, non-empty line of the script should be a call to
source test library functions:

<pre>
. /usr/share/inquisitor/functions-test
</pre>

* Scripts must include the following comments with meta-information
right after shebang:

<pre>
# NAME=USB GPRS modem
# DESCRIPTION=Test GPRS modem, connected using USB
# DESTROYS_HDD=false
# IS_INTERACTIVE=false
# POWEROFF_DURING_TEST=false
# VERSION=0.1
# VAR=DEV:string:/dev/ttyUSB0:Name of device to test
# VAR=ANSWER_ATI:string:OK:String to get after ATI
# VAR=CHAT_TIMEOUT:int:5:Timeout for waiting for answer
</pre>

The format of meta-information is detailed below.

h3. Meta-information

Meta-information is given in key=value pairs, screened in shell comments
(@# @). Following keys must be defined:

* *NAME* is a short, human-readable name of test that would be displayed
in all kinds of user interfaces. Approximate limit is 50 characters.
Word "test" shouldn't be used in NAME, as it would appear somewhere near
these string in UI anyway, but words like "benchmark" would be helpful.

* *DESCRIPTION* is a long, reasonably full description of test. It
should include:
** what precisely test does,
** what steps in what sequence would it take to do it,
** what results would it generate, if any.

* *TAGS* is a comma-separated list of tags that would be used in UI to
navigate in tests. Examples of tags: hdd, ram, cpu, legacy, benchmark.

* *VERSION* is a version of test; if test changes significiantly, it
should be pumped, thus it's possible to distinguish older test results
from newer ones in the database.

Also, following keys may be used optionally:

* *DESTROYS_HDD* (possible values: false, true; default value: false) -
test destroys contents of one or all hard disc drives in process. This
test should not be ran if HDDs contain any important data.

* *IS_INTERACTIVE* (possible values: false, true; default value: false)
- test is interactive, i.e. it requires user interaction in process.

* *POWEROFF_DURING_TEST* (possible values: false, true; default value:
false) - system under test would normally poweroff during this test;
it's not a sign of faulty hardware, but a normal course of test.
Watchdog should act accordingly.

* *VAR* defines an input variable for the test. Value must be defined as
following: @VAR=name:type:default-value:description@:
** *name* is a name of variable that would be requested from user or
received from the profile and defined for the script.
** *type* is a type name from XSD, for example:
*** int - 32-bit integer value
*** string - string value
*** hexBinary - hexadecimal string
*** boolean - a boolean value ("false" or "true")
** *description* is a human-readable description that would be shown to
users in command-line / graphical / web interfaces. It's recommended to
limit this string to approximately 50 characters.

h3. Assumptions

There are some assumptions that could be used when writing such scripts
(i.e. scripts should not check for these things themselves and can trust
the calling environment that would provide these services):

* Test scripts always get all the variables they have declared in
meta-information, properly typed, etc.
* Test scripts are always ran as separate process, not sourced. Thus
it's acceptable to use @exit@ to stop execution, it's safe to trap
signals to do cleanup on script exits, etc.

h3. Recommendations

Recommended, but not mandatory things:

* Scripts should use @/bin/sh@ as an interpreter.
* Scripts should use @-e@ (exit on non-zero exit statuses, i.e. fail on
errors) and @-f@ (disable globbing) options of an interpreter.
